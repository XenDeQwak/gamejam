## Mechanics
<br>
<p align = "center", width = 75%>
  You play as Olivia's father, who has just lost his job. For this reason, he tried gambling as his main source of income. With $1000 as his savings, is he willing to go all out to break the loop of poverty, or is he going to be devoured by the loop? <br>

  <br>
  <br>Find out as you progress in the game, as it will trigger certain story events to know the fate of Olivia's father and his family. <br>

## Concept
Real events of the presence of gambling addiction in the Philippines inspire this concept. With this year's theme, "Break the Loop", we want to convey the message that gambling is by no means a solution to poverty, and it will devour the lives of those who have been addicted to it. The game will be officially over once you have successfully quit the game, thus "breaking the never-ending loop" of the father's gambling addiction.
